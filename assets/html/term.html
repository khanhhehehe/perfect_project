                        <p>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American
                            Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer
                            Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration
                            Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org.
                            Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s
                            consumer arbitration page, <a
                                href="https://www.adr.org/consumer">https://www.adr.org/consumer</a>. If there is any
                            inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement,
                            the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator
                            determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not
                            result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions
                            of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide,
                            including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
                            Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more
                            streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same
                            damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under
                            these Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in
                            court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</p>
                        <p>Unless Company and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a
                            reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to
                            travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location,
                            the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Company agrees
                            that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of
                            documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person
                            hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a
                            hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the
                            arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient
                            to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>

                        <p><b>&emsp;e.&emsp;Costs of Arbitration</b></p>
                        <p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration
                            Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration
                            Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Company
                            will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you
                            are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your
                            portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason
                            that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Company will
                            pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the
                            costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Company
                            will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the
                            arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by
                            the AAA Rules.</p>

                        <p><b>&emsp;f.&emsp;Confidentiality</b></p>
                        <p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the
                            arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>

                        <p><b>&emsp;g.&emsp;Severability</b></p>
                        <p>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement
                            (other than the subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions
                            and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to
                            replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
                            that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
                            provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or
                            the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled
                            “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid
                            or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void,
                            unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to
                            claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms of Service will continue
                            to apply.</p>

                        <p><b>&emsp;g.&emsp;Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</b></p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary, Company agrees that
                            if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the
                            Notice Address) while you are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by
                            sending Company written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice
                            Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will
                            arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration
                            Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any
                            subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).</p>

                        <h2>Termination</h2>
                        <p>You agree that Company, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any
                            part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service,
                            for any reason, including for lack of use or if Company believes that you have violated or
                            acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected
                            fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of
                            the Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Company may also in
                            its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof,
                            with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under
                            any provision of these Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and
                            acknowledge and agree that Company may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all
                            related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or
                            the Service. Further, you agree that Company will not be liable to you or any third party
                            for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>

                        <h2>User Disputes</h2>
                        <p>You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in
                            connection with the Service, and Company will have no liability or responsibility with
                            respect thereto. Company reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in
                            any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Service.</p>

                        <h2>General</h2>
                        <p>These Terms of Service (together with the terms incorporated by reference herein) constitute
                            the entire agreement between you and Company governing your access and use of the Service,
                            and supersede any prior agreements between you and Company with respect to the Service. You
                            also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use
                            Third-Party Services, third-party content or third-party software. These Terms of Service
                            will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
                            law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set
                            forth above, you and Company submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state
                            and federal courts located within San Francisco, California. The failure of Company to
                            exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a
                            waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a
                            court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court
                            should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and
                            the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree
                            that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising
                            out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one
                            (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version
                            of these Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in
                            judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Service to
                            the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records
                            originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign these Terms of
                            Service without the prior written consent of Company, but Company may assign or transfer
                            these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in
                            these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. As
                            used in these Terms of Service, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof,
                            will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by
                            the words “without limitation.” Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail.
                            The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other
                            matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service. Company will not
                            be in default hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its
                            obligations where such failure or delay is due to civil disturbances, riot, epidemic,
                            hostilities, war, terrorist attack, embargo, natural disaster, acts of God, flood, fire,
                            sabotage, fluctuations or unavailability of electrical power, network access or equipment,
                            or any other circumstances or causes beyond Company’s reasonable control.</p>
