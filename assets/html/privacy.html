        <h2>6. International data transfers</h2>
        <p>
          If you provide us with your Personal Data when using the Services from
          the EEA, Switzerland or the UK or other regions of the world with laws
          governing data collection and use that may differ from United States
          law, then please note that you are transferring your Personal Data
          outside of those regions to the United States for storage and
          processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we transfer your Personal Data internationally, these countries may
          not provide the same protections as the data protection laws where you
          are based. &nbsp;We will ensure that relevant safeguards are in place to
          afford adequate protection for your Personal Data and we will comply
          with applicable data protection laws, in particular if you reside in
          the EEA, Switzerland or UK by relying on an EU Commission or UK
          government adequacy decision, on contractual protections for the
          transfer of your Personal Data or a derogation if available. &nbsp;For more
          information about how we transfer Personal Data internationally,
          please contact us as set out in the “<b>Contact Us</b>” section below.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Children’s privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Our Services are not directed to children, and we do not knowingly
          collect Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13. &nbsp;If you are a
          parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us
          with Personal Data, please contact us as set out in the “<b>Contact Us</b>” section below.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Retention of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
          We retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary to
          fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed, in
          accordance with our retention procedures, and in accordance with
          applicable laws or until you withdraw your consent (where applicable).
        </p>

        <p>
          To determine the appropriate retention period for your personal data,
          we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data,
          the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your
          Personal Data, the purposes for which we use your Personal Data and
          whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
          applicable legal requirements.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Security of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative
          measures designed to protect against unauthorized access, misuse,
          loss, disclosure, alteration and destruction of Personal Data we
          process. &nbsp;Unfortunately, data transmission over the Internet cannot be
          guaranteed as completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect
          your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its security.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Links to other sites</h2>
        <p>
          The Services may contain links to other sites that are not operated by
          us. &nbsp;If you click a third party link, you will be directed to that
          third party's site. &nbsp;We strongly advise you to review the privacy
          policy of every site you visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
          privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.
